# 1. Use the inbuilt dataset 'titanic' as used in the above problem. Plot a box plot for distribution of age with respect to each gender along with the information about whether they survived or not. (Column names : 'sex' and 'age')
# 2. Write observations on the inference from the above statistics.

print("1. **Male Age Distribution**:")

print("2. **Female Age Distribution**:")
print("   - Non-survivors: Median age around 25, with a narrower range (IQR ~18-36). Fewer outliers.")
print("   - Survivors: Median age around 28, with a broader range (IQR ~20-38) and some older outliers (~50-60).")
print("3. **Survival Patterns**:")
print("   - Males: Younger males had a slightly better survival chance, but age variation is wide for both groups.")
print("   - Females: Survivors tend to have a slightly higher median age than non-survivors, suggesting older females were prioritized.")
print("4. **Missing Data**: Age has missing values (~177 rows), which may slightly skew the distributions.")
print("5. **General Trend**: Females show less age variation among non-survivors, while males have more outliers, especially among non-survivors.")
